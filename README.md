My dotfiles preferences, built in a new Mac. I intend to update this frequently as I add more stuff in there. Also, it should have a Linux preference soon.

It is managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) and git - for now it's good enough! 

There's also a mirror of this repository in codeberg, just in case github turns out to be... well, microsofted.
